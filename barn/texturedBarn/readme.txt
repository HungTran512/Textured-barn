Project 3: Texture mapping
1. I add a function named displayTexture that would map the texture from TW.loadTextures on to the barn.
And add a light source  at (320, 390, 700).

2. There is no currently known bugs, the pictures are not the power of two so my chrome browser just automatically resize it.

3. I used two material to and use a repeat and mirror wrapping pattern around the body and the roof of the barn. Next I add the TextureCoords to the barn for the mesh model and then add it to the scene.

Note: I use five server to run the html file.
